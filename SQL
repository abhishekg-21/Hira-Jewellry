You’ve hit **P3005** because Prisma sees an existing schema but your `_prisma_migrations` table has no history yet. Fix it by **baselining** your current DB schema (no data loss), or by **resetting** (drops data).

Below are two clear paths—pick one.

---

## Option 1 — Fastest (drops data in `public`)

If this is a dev DB and you can wipe it:

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
# then
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

You’re done.

---

## Option 2 — Keep data (Baseline the existing DB)

This tells Prisma “treat the current DB as already migrated”.

### A) Make sure CLI uses the direct host

In `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider           = "postgresql"
  url                = env("DATABASE_URL")   // pooled
  directUrl          = env("DIRECT_URL")     // direct (no -pooler)
  shadowDatabaseUrl  = env("DIRECT_URL")     // direct
}
```

In `.env`:

```ini
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...-pooler....neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://...WITHOUT-POOLER....neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
```

### B) (Recommended) Archive your existing migrations (so they don’t interfere)

Move them out of the way (keep a backup):

* Windows:

  ```cmd
  ren prisma\migrations migrations_backup_%RANDOM%
  mkdir prisma\migrations
  ```

### C) Create a **baseline** migration from the live DB

* **PowerShell**:

  ```powershell
  mkdir prisma\migrations\0000_baseline
  npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-url "$env:DIRECT_URL" --script > prisma/migrations/0000_baseline/migration.sql
  ```
* **CMD** (paste your full DIRECT\_URL):

  ```cmd
  mkdir prisma\migrations\0000_baseline
  npx prisma migrate diff --from-empty --to-url "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@ep-square-waterfall-a1zlyh22.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require" --script > prisma\migrations\0000_baseline\migration.sql
  ```

### D) Mark that baseline as **applied**

```bash
npx prisma migrate resolve --applied 0000_baseline
```

### E) Deploy (now Prisma has history)

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
```

> From here on, whenever you change your Prisma schema, just run:
>
> ```bash
> npx prisma migrate dev --name some_change
> ```
>
> and then `npx prisma migrate deploy` in environments where you deploy.

---

### Notes specific to your case

* Your current DB already includes `products` with the new columns (`shop_by_material`, `shop_by_price`) and other fixes. Baseline will capture exactly that state—no further SQL will run.
* If you prefer to **keep** your old 4 migration folders instead of archiving them, you can manually **mark them applied** in order:

  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate resolve --applied <first_migration_folder_name>
  npx prisma migrate resolve --applied <second_migration_folder_name>
  ... (repeat for all 4)
  ```

  Then run `npx prisma migrate deploy`. Only do this if those migrations truly match the current DB; otherwise they can conflict later.

If you hit any error on a specific step, paste the exact message and I’ll give you the one-liner to fix it.

npx prisma generate
